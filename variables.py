'In here we assign the result of this operation to the result variable'
result = 5 + 7


print(result)

result2 = result / 2

print('now we can use the result as a value and make more operations with it')

print(result2)


test_123_CAP_LETTERS = 'test'

name = "jenny"

#new math operation +=,-=,/=,*=
#num1 = num1 + 5  is the same as num1+=5

num1 = 12

num1+=5

print(num1)
