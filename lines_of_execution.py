'''
python does not see the empty lines in the code but you do

this
print()
print()

and this are the same for python
print()

print()


python also ignores white space within a line
print('this       will      not      read  the  space between')
print(5+7               +2)

pytho cares about indentation of an entire line

    print() will give you an error

you can't add space at the begining of a line



we see physical lines and python sees a logical line
print() print()  python needs to execute one line at a time so this willl give you an error

to break physical line to logical line  use \

a = 1+2+3\
    2+3+8
this will work

or 
print(); print()
